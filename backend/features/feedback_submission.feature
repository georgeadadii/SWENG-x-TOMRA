Feature: Feedback Submission

  Scenario: Submit feedback for a misclassified image
    Given an image has been classified and stored in the Graph DB
    When a user submits feedback correcting the label (e.g., "husky" â†’ "wolf")
    Then the backend should update the Graph DB with the corrected label
    And the feedback should be flagged for review by the system administrator
